# Fix Git Configuration in Jenkins

## ‚úÖ What Was Done
- Git repository has been initialized in your project
- Files have been committed

## üîß What You Need to Do

### In Jenkins Configuration:

1. **Go to your pipeline**: http://localhost:9080/job/freelancer-pipeline/configure

2. **In the "Pipeline" section**, change:

   **Before:**
   - Definition: Pipeline script from SCM
   - SCM: Git
   - Repository URL: `file:///workspace`

   **After:**
   - Definition: **Select "Pipeline script"** (the first option, not "from SCM")
   - This will show a script editor
   - Copy ALL the content from your Jenkinsfile
   - Paste it into the script editor

3. **Scroll down and click "Save"**

### OR Alternative: Update the Git URL

Change the Repository URL to the absolute path inside the container:

- Before: `file:///workspace`
- After: `file:///C:/Users/srika/Downloads/resume files/Freelancer-main`

But the first method (using Pipeline script directly) is easier!

## üìù Copy Jenkinsfile Content

You can copy the content from the `Jenkinsfile` file in your project root, or I can provide it here.

---

## üöÄ After Saving

1. Go back to the pipeline page
2. Click **"Build Now"** 
3. Watch your first build start!
